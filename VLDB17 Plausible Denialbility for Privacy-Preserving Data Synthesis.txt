This papaer mainly introduces two things: plausible denialbility by testing, and the differenantial private bayes network learning. The synthetic data is generated by sampling from learned Bayes network. The intuition is that, if one can learn a bayes network which represent the dependency of the variables, then one is able to generate synthetic data from sampling. The privacy garantee are all dependent on the data. I dont think the DP machine learning is a new task. I dont think plausible denialbility garantee all privacy requirement of generating synthetic data (the what is the new attack vector?)

one problem of this mathod is that, to train/learn a bayes network is NP-hard problem. And the when data is sparse (should be differentiated bewteen data sparsity and pattern sparsity), the bayes network would probably not work well.
